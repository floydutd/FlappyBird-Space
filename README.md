    This is my attempt to recreate the famous, "Flappy Bird" game in pygame.

I thought of doing something new to the Flappy Bird game and so far I can only think of Flappy Bird Space. Space.jpg, Space1.jpg, Space2.jpg, Space3.jpg, Space4.jpg are the background images of the game and the images scroll along the screen as you play the game(which I think is pretty cool :D). 

I wanted to add sounds for different actions in the game, like if you collide then a particular sound and if you accelerate upwards or downwards then another sound, but I am new to Pygame and I haven't been able to figure that out yet. So, I decided to use pygame.mixer and play a music that I found online. I googled for "Space music" and I think the music that I have used blends with game.

Apart from that I wanted to do something with the tunnels as well, the standard "Flappy Bird" game has green tunnels, so I wanted to change that with something like a pile of rocks. My photoshop skills are not upto the mark to create such a texture or anything related to that. So, I ended up creating Brown-ish tunnels.

And for the bird, I wanted to use a Sprite sheet but couldn't find it online and I am not that skillful to create one on my own. So, I used the Standard Yellow bird's picture.
